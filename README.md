# politicaltrollbots2018midterms

This is the code used for my research project that detected Twitter trollbots attempting to influence the 2018 midterm elections. The first Python file passes accounts received from another program through a Botometer API and writes them to a CSV (first CSV). The second Python file reads this CSV and runs the accounts through two other bot detection services to determine which accounts are likely political trollbots and appends it to a final CSV. The paper can be read in its entirety via the PDF uploaded here.
